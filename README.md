# Styled Player List
It's a simple mod that allows server owners to style their player list as they like!
With full permission/requirement support, placeholder api support, multiple styles and player list name overrides.

## Commands (and permissions):
- `/styledplayerlist` - Main command (`styledplayerlist.main`, available by default)
- `/styledplayerlist reload` - Reloads configuration and styles (requires `styledplayerlist.reload`)
- `/styledplayerlist switch <style>` or `/plstyle <style>` - Changes selected style (`styledplayerlist.switch`, available by default)
- `/styledplayerlist switchothers <players> <style> ` - Changes selected style of players (`styledplayerlist.switch.others`)

## Configuration:
You can find config file in `./config/styledplayerlist/`.
Some config options allow for dynamic predicates (marked as `{/* PREDICATE */}`).
See [this page](https://github.com/Patbox/PredicateAPI/blob/1.19.4/BUILTIN.md) for more details.
[Formatting uses PlaceholderAPI's Text Parser for which docs you can find here](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/text-format/).

```json5
{
  // Config version, do not change. Used only for updating from one version to another
  "config_version": 2,
  // Allows selecting id of default player list style
  "default_style": "default",
  // Allows changing messages sent by this mods commands.
  "messages": {
    "switch": "Your player list style has been changed to: <gold>${style}</gold>",
    "unknown": "<red>This style doesn't exist!</red>",
    "no_permission": "<red>You don't have required permissions!</red>"
  },
  // Modifies how player name is displayed
  "player": {
    // Toggles this feature.
    "modify_name": false,
    // Toggles modification of text on right of player name
    "modify_right_text": false,
    // Hides player name from player list. Doesn't have any effect on commands, suggestions or entity visibility!
    "hidden": false,
    // Disables this formatting, forcing it to use vanilla one.
    "passthrough": false,
    // Default format of player name
    "format": "%player:displayname%",
    // Text displayed on right of the name
    "right_text": "",
    // Enables sending updates when player sends a message
    "update_on_chat_message": false,
    // Enables sending updates every provided amount of ticks. -1 disables it
    "update_tick_time": -1,
    // Custom styles
    "styles": [
      {
        // Requirement of style, used for applying
        "require": {/* PREDICATE */},
        // Applied formatting, same as one above
        "format": "...",
        // Text displayed on right of the name
        "right_text": "",
        // Optional. Disables this formatting, forcing it to use vanilla one.
        "passthrough": false,
        // Optional, hides player name from player list. Doesn't have any effect on commands, suggestions or entity visibility!
        "hidden": false
      }
    ]
  },
  // Makes player list show in singleplayer without lan enabled
  "client_show_in_singleplayer": true
}
```
### Styles:
This mod allows having multiple styles, that can be selected by players (just put them in `./config/styledplayerlist/styles/` and use `/styledplayerlist reload` command)

```json5
{
  // Predicate required for usage of this style, required by player
  "require": {/* PREDICATE */},
  // Style name used for display
  "style_name": "Default",
  // Time between updates of the style in ticks. 20 is 1 second. Used for formatting and placeholders
  "update_tick_time": 20,
  // Header of player list style, using simple/static definition (works in "list_footer" too). Allows formatting
  "list_header": [
    "...",
    "..."
  ],
  // Footer of player list style, using animated definition (works in "list_header" too). Allows formatting
  "list_footer": {
    // Number of changes required to change into next frame. This means it updates every (change_rate * update_tick_time) ticks 
    "change_rate": 1,
    // Frames of displayed text. There is no limit for amount of them
    "values": [
      [
        "<red>..."
      ],
      [
        "<blue>..."
      ]
    ],
  },
  // Makes this style hidden from autocompletion, without changing requirements
  "hidden_in_commands": false
}
```
